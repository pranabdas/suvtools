### Installation

We will need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) (version `3.9` - `3.13`)
installed in the system. You can check the Python version in your system, using
`python --version` in a terminal application. We can install latest stable
release of **suvtools** from PyPI:
```bash
pip3 install --upgrade suvtools
```


### Importing suvtools into your program:

Import `suvtools` as `suv`, so that we can refer to it in short (e.g.,
`suv.load`):
```python
import suvtools as suv
```

### Jupyter Notebook

I will be using Jupyter notebook to demonstrate the examples. You can install
Jupyter Lab using pip:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade jupyterlab
```

Launch jupyterlab and create or open Python 3 notebook:
```bash
jupyter lab
```
